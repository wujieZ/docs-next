# v3.vuejs.org

This site is built with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`.

## Writing

See the [Vue Docs Writing Guide](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/writing-guide.html) for our rules and recommendations on writing and maintaining documentation.

> The docs are in beta: The team is currently in the midst of changes and we are not ready for additional contributions yet. All content is subject to change. If you see a problem that you would like to bring to our attention, please [create an issue](https://github.com/vuejs/docs-next/issues/new) and we will get to it when we can. You may want to wait until the content is finalized, though.
